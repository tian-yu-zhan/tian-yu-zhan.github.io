I am Director of Strategic Capability, TA and Safety Statistics at [AbbVie](https://www.abbvie.com/). One of my major responsibilities is to work closely with the VP of Statistics to ensure alignment within the department of Statistics before key developmental governance meetings. My research projects are mainly motivated by emerging challenges in clinical development and have delivered profound business impact at AbbVie.
